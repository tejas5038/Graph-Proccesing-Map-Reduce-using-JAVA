# Connected Components in a Graph using Map-Reduce

The purpose of this project is to develop a graph analysis program using Map-Reduce that finds the connected components of any undirected graph and prints the size of these connected components. A connected component of a graph is a subgraph of the graph in which there is a path from any two vertices in the subgraph. For the graphs: 0,8,9 and 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. The program prints the sizes of these connected components: 3 and 7.

graph.java takes 3 arguments in the order:
